# Serverless Saves on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

**Traditional** web sites, applications and services must run *24x7*:

  - **Self-hosted**: You're paying for physical hardware and network which is under-utilized because it would take you *days* to increase scale (if you're lucky)
  - **Virtualized Servers**: You may be in the cloud, you can scale-up or scale-out, but you still can't turn your services off when there's no traffic. You're still paying for 24x7 hosting.

**Serverless** doesn't cost you anything to host - you only pay for *actual* compute and storage:

 - No more servers to manage - that's handled for you
 - No more paying for extra, unused capacity - pay for exactly what you use and no more
